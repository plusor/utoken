  <p class="p-normal">The mnemonic is used to derive multiple private keys. It is a unique wallet phrase that gives you a human readable format of words to backup your wallet for recovery. It is typically a phrase that allows you to access an infinite number of accounts. At its purest form it is a pattern of letters, words or associations that help you remember the information easily. </p>
  <p class="p-normal">The accounts you can access with this phrase are determined by the technical "path".Utoken allows you to import a wallet using the mnemonic from different paths. However, you cannot export a private key on Utoken.</p>
  <p class="p-normal">Here is an example of what it should look like:</p>
